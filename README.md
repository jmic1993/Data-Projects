The files in this repository are as follows:

1) MovieRecommender.pdf: This is an analysis of the publically available movie-lens dataset using R. I compare KNN and SVD based recommender systems for both time and performance. 

2) Facial_Recognition.ipynb: This is an attempt to create a classifier for faces using the Open CV library in Python. It discusses the tools I used, as well as their shortcomings. There seem to be some glitches when trying to upload the notebook with the filmclip synthesized therein already embedded. As a result, I've posted this separately as the file titled LBHP2.mp4.
