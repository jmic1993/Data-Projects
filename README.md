# Data Projects

The files in this repository are as follows:

## Implementations:

1) [Regression_Implementation (R)](https://github.com/jmichaels1993/Data-Science/blob/master/Regression_Implementation.pdf): This is an implementation of regression using batch and stochastic gradient descent. Rates of convergence are compared between the two methods. 

2) [K-Means Clustering (Python)](https://github.com/jmichaels1993/Data-Science/blob/master/K%20Means%20Image%20Segmentation.ipynb): Implementation of K-Means clustering using Python. The algorithm is applied to image segmentation. 

## Data Analysis:
1) [MovieRecommender (R)](https://github.com/jmichaels1993/Data-Science/blob/master/Movie%20Recommender.pdf): This is an analysis of the publically available [MovieLens](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/) 1M dataset using R. I compare KNN and SVD based recommender systems for both time and performance. 

2) [Facial_Recognition.ipynb (Python)](https://github.com/jmichaels1993/Data-Science/blob/master/Facial%20Recognition.ipynb): This is an attempt to create a classifier for faces using the OpenCV library in Python. In this case, I chose to create a classifier to recognize Barrack Obama vs. Joe Biden. Training data were collected manually by using Quick-Time Player's screen capture feature on several videos of the two, and then using OpenCV to extract individual frames, detect faces, and crop them down to include only the facial region. The notebook discusses in more depth the tools I used, as well as their shortcomings. It's still a work in progress, but below is a demo of what I've come up with so far:
