The files in this repository are as follows:

1) MovieRecommender.pdf: This is an analysis of the publically available movie-lens dataset using R. I compare KNN and SVD based recommender systems in terms of time and performance. 

2) Facial_Recognition.ipynb: This is an attempt to create a classifier for faces using the Open CV library in Python. It discusses the methods for doing so, as well as their shortcomings. There seem to be some glitches when trying to upload the notebook with the filmclip synthesized therein already embedded. As a result, I've posted this separately as the file titled LBHP2.mp4.
